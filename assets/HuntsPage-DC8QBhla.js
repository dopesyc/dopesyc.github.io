to a decade. This is one of the highest success rates in the province. We manage this by: regulating the number of hunters we take, using fresh quality bait hauled to the hunting area in our own reefer trailer, setting strategically located baits, and by insuring that our guides know the area we hunt. Our past success rate speak for itself and when compared to the possibly less than 50% hunter success in other provinces/states, it’s easy to see that Alberta is the place to be for fantastic bear hunting. Eric Rauhanen and the Silver Fox Outfitters “team” are the right choice for you. </p></div><div class="header">The Bears</div><div><p> Our area has one of the highest trophy bear populations in North America with about 10 to 15% being color phased. Light hunting pressure allows us to produce a higher percentage of larger, older boars for our hunters. This is representative of a mature population. Bears are so plentiful here that each hunter is allowed two tags. </p></div><div class="header">Bait Hunting</div><div><p> We use beavers, butcher scraps, bakery scraps, restaurant grease, oats, molasses and specialty bear lures for bait and it’s hauled to site and stored in a 28 ft reefer trailer. Our baits are set when there’s still snow on the ground, several weeks before your arrival. Maintained regularly they become the bear’s primary food source. Baits are accessible by four-wheel drive trucks, all-terrain vehicles or jet boat. As nocturnal animals, bears are hunted primarily in the evening. Hunters are taken to active bait sites in the late afternoon. Portable tree stands are the preferred method in our area. They are 12 to 15 feet up and 15 to 20 yards from the bait. We are quite far north and the sunsets late. We are normally finished hunting by 10:30 p.m. and out of the bush by midnight. </p></div><div class="header">Spot &amp; Stalk</div><div><p> Few things can compare to the excitement of stalking trophy bears. We offer both five day as well as the recommended ten day hunt. They are normally restricted to one hunter per guide to ensure a maximum number of opportunities at quality bears. Highly mobile spike camps are utilized, allowing the hunter to instantly move to where the game is and to cover more ground. Hunters that have spot and stalk hunted know that nothing compares to taking a trophy bruin from the ground. </p></div><div class="header">Bag Limit</div><div><p> We hunt a two-bear area; each tag can be purchased individually.

You can look up resident success rates at: <a href="https://mywildalberta.ca/hunting/hunters-harvest.aspx" target="_blank">https://mywildalberta.ca/hunting/hunters-harvest.aspx</a>. The photos will show you the kind of game you can expect to see in the areas we hunt. We had an Average season in 2021, 2 bowhunters saw 7 moose but no bow shooting chances (but both would have tagged out with rifles) the 3rd hunter got a shot but he missed the mark and the bull got away. We’re planning to make it even better next fall. We have been very consistent with the amount of game we’ve produced for our bowhunting clients. <br><br> With difficult times in the North American economy, I am providing my clients an a great deal for the upcoming season, these may be the best prices you’ll find on hunts in Alberta. I am offering my hunt for $5190. plus, licenses and tax. This covers meals, tent camp accommodation, airport pickup and 2 on 1 guiding. I also offer a drop camp option for paired hunters starting at $2440 per person plus license fees, this is probably the best bow hunt deal available in Alberta. To show you that we’re serious about our clients tagging their bull we’ve incorporated a trophy fee paid only if you tag your bull. We have a lot of great things planned for our clients and I would really like it if you would be a part of it. We take VISA/MC for deposits to make it easier for you to book your hunt. Please call me if you have any questions at all about the great hunts, we run up here. <br><br> We specialize in Bowhunting trophy moose. Our primary hunting area allows bowhunting only during the pre-rut, has some of the highest densities of moose in Alberta, and has an excellent bull to cow ratio. Calling moose is incredibly exciting and our most productive method of getting trophy bulls into bow range. Other common methods we use include hunting natural mineral licks, or heavily used feeding areas. </p></div><div class="header">Elk</div><div><p> Our area also has a great abundance of other big game species including Elk. We bugle in these bulls during the rut or setup on the fringe of agricultural feeding areas and hunt from tree stands. </p></div><div class="header">Whitetail</div><div><p> Alberta is famous for its great deer hunting and its giant trophy bucks. Alberta whitetails are the most predictable and easiest to bow hunt in September. We hunt their travel routes in the morning and evening as these bucks move to and from bedding areas to feed in the lush farm fields. </p></div><div class="header">Game Birds</div><div><p> Both ruff grouse and spruce grouse are very plentiful and are a lot of fun to hunt in the midday period whether bow or rifle hunting. Licensing for game birds is optional. </p></div><div class="header">Wolf</div><div><p> A healthy wolf population exists in our area, and a wolf/coyote license is recommended for every hunter. Wolves are very wary and don’t offer hunters a second chance, but the opportunity is there for the vigilant hunter. Bow hunters have had shooting opportunities every year. </p></div><div class="header">Fishing</div><div><p> Rainbow trout are abundant in the creeks as are the northern pike in the many lakes. A little fishing at midday can be a relaxing break the wearied hunter needs. </p></div><div class="header">Location</div><div><p> The primary hunting area located a short 2 hours drive west of the Edmonton International airport, near the town of Edson in the beautiful foothills, agricultural fringe area of west central Alberta. Our hunting areas have some of the highest moose densities in the province. Other advantages of this new area include: easier / more cost-effective travel arrangements for our hunters, excellent access, controlled resident numbers and Bowhunting in the pre-rut and rut. We’re now hunting in the best area in Alberta for moose and an area that has excellent elk, whitetail and mule deer numbers. This move helps us to expand our line of high-quality reasonably priced hunts that we offer to all hunters. </p></div><div class="header">Fall Hunts</div><div><p> Our primary fall hunts are for Elk, Moose and Whitetails.
